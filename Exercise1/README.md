Track 1b: Customer churn prediction

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravtopre/bank-customer-churn-dataset/download?datasetVersionNumber=1

Objective: Build a binary classifier that predicts if a bank’s customer is going to churn or not.

Your solution should address at least the following steps:

Read the dataset and display columns.

Analyze the data and state your observations.

Select columns that are probably important to predict if a customer is going to churn (i.e., if a customer is stopping doing business with a company). You can also remove columns or create new ones, motivating your choices.

Create training and test sets.

Train a Machine Learning model to predict if a customer is going to churn.

Evaluate your model on the test set, describing the metrics you are using and why you are using them. Comment on the results.
